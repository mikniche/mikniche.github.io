Dear future self,

You've woken up today with a sudden urge to put your thoughts into written word. I warn you now this is dangerous territory. There's no deniability once it's on paper. Besides you aren't a very good writer, remember your English lessons? You always mix up there, their and they're, use far too many commas, and switch between tenses at a seemingly random cadence. But when have you ever listened to good advice...

Now I'm leaving you to your own devices.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
