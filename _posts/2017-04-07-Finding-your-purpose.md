I've been wondering alot recently about what to do in life.
> I've always been content, managed to find happiness in situations where other's around me counldn't and I'm grateful for that. But recently this has caused me to question what makes me happy, what do I want to do in life that pushes me from simply content to becoming positively enthralled with how I'm living and what I do.
